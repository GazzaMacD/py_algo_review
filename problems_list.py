1: Return true if a given string is a palindrome, false otherwise.
A string is a palindrome if it reads the same forwards as backwards. That means, after reversing it, it is still the same string. For example: "abcdcba", or "racecar".

"""
2: Given a sorted array of unique integers and a target integer, return true if there exists a pair of numbers that sum to target, false otherwise. This problem is similar to Two Sum.
For example, given nums = [1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 14, 15] and target = 13, return true because 4 + 9 = 13.

4: 392. Is Subsequence.
Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.
A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

"""
5: Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.
You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

"""
6: Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.
Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].

7.Given a string s, reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence while still preserving whitespace and initial word order.

Example 1:
Input: s = "Let's take LeetCode contest"
Output: "s'teL ekat edoCteeL tsetnoc"

Example 2:
Input: s = "God Ding"
Output: "doG gniD"

Constraints:
 1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
 s contains printable ASCII characters.
 s does not contain any leading or trailing spaces.
 There is at least one word in s.
 All the words in s are separated by a single space.

"""
Given a string s, reverse the string according to the following rules:
    All the characters that are not English letters remain in the same position.
    All the English letters (lowercase or uppercase) should be reversed.
Return s after reversing it.

Example 1:

Input: s = "ab-cd"
Output: "dc-ba"

Example 2:

Input: s = "a-bC-dEf-ghIj"
Output: "j-Ih-gfE-dCba"

Example 3:

Input: s = "Test1ng-Leet=code-Q!"

Constraints:

    1 <= s.length <= 100
    s consists of characters with ASCII values in the range [33, 122].
    s does not contain '\"' or '\\'.

1: Given an array of positive integers nums and an integer k, find the length of the longest subarray whose sum is less than or equal to k.

"""
2: You are given a binary substring s (a string containing only "0" and "1"). An operation involves flipping a "0" into a "1". What is the length of the longest substring containing only "1" after performing at most one operation?

For example, given s = "1101100111", the answer is 5. If you perform the operation at index 2, the string becomes 1111100111.

"""
3: Given an array of positive integers nums and an integer k, return the number of contiguous subarrays where the product of all the elements in the subarray is strictly less than k.

For example, given the input nums = [10, 5, 2, 6], k = 100, the answer is 8. The subarrays with products less than k are:

[10], [5], [2], [6], [10, 5], [5, 2], [2, 6], [5, 2, 6]

Key idea: Whenever you see a problem asking for the number of subarrays, think of this: at each index, how many valid subarrays end at this index? Let's split the 8 subarrays by their ending indices:

4: Maximum Average Subarray 1
You are given an integer array nums consisting of n elements, and an integer k.

Find a contiguous subarray whose length is equal to k that has the maximum average value and return this value. Any answer with a calculation error less than 10-5 will be accepted.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,12,-5,-6,50,3], k = 4
Output: 12.75000
Explanation: Maximum average is (12 - 5 - 6 + 50) / 4 = 51 / 4 = 12.75
