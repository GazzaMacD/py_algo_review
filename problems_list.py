""" ================== Two Pointers =================="""
"""
1: Return true if a given string is a palindrome, false otherwise.
A string is a palindrome if it reads the same forwards as backwards. That means, after reversing it, it is still the same string. For example: "abcdcba", or "racecar".
"""

"""
2: Given a sorted array of unique integers and a target integer, return true if there exists a pair of numbers that sum to target, false otherwise. This problem is similar to Two Sum.
For example, given nums = [1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 14, 15] and target = 13, return true because 4 + 9 = 13.
"""

"""
3: Given two sorted integer arrays, return an array that combines both of them and is also sorted.
"""

"""
4: 392. Is Subsequence.
Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.
A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).
"""

"""
5: Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.
You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
"""

"""
6: Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.
Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].
"""

""" ================== Sliding Window =================="""
"""
1: Given an array of positive integers nums and an integer k, find the length of the longest subarray whose sum is less than or equal to k.
"""
"""
2: You are given a binary substring s (a string containing only "0" and "1"). An operation involves flipping a "0" into a "1". What is the length of the longest substring containing only "1" after performing at most one operation?

For example, given s = "1101100111", the answer is 5. If you perform the operation at index 2, the string becomes 1111100111.
